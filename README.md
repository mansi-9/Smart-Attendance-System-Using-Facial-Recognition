# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Facial-Recognition
There are two parts- Enrollment and recognition. In enrollment, the students have to register themselves by entering details. In pre-processing phase, detection of faces, extraction of the features, detection of extracted features will be processed and will be stored in data base. And in recognition phase, after the detection of extracted features, a canonical form of the facial surface is computed and recognition itself is performed. Faces will be detected from live video/photo of people present there and then their detected faces will be compared with images present in the database.  If match found, attendance will be marked in excel sheet along with time. At last, this attendance list can be used by respective higher authority.
